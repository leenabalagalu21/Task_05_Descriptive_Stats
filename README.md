# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats
This project explores the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT when prompted with natural language questions about structured sports data. Specifically, it analyzes the 2025 Syracuse Women‚Äôs Lacrosse season using two datasets:

syracuse_lacrosse_2025_cleaned.csv: Game-level results (scores, opponents, date, win/loss, location). 

syracuse_lacrosse_2025_player_stats.csv: Player-level statistics (goals, assists, games played, turnovers, accuracy, etc.).

The goal is to challenge an LLM to answer basic, analytical, and strategic questions using prompt engineering, and then validate or correct the model‚Äôs responses with Python.The project also extends into deeper statistical analysis to uncover performance trends and coaching insights.

## Interesting Insights from the Data

- **Top Performer Efficiency**: Olivia Adamson played only 3 games but scored 10 goals and 6 assists‚Äîmaking her the most efficient offensive contributor (5.33 points per game).
- **Elite Playmaker**: Emma Ward not only led in assists but also contributed significantly to the team‚Äôs goal generation, with a combined offensive total of 76 (Goals + Assists).
- **Tight Competition**: 5 of Syracuse‚Äôs 9 losses were by a margin of 3 goals or fewer, suggesting close contests and high potential to flip outcomes.
- **Biggest Victory**: The most dominant win came against UALBANY with a score of 21‚Äì9.
- **Consistent Finisher**: Emma Muchnick led the team in total goals (34) and maintained a solid scoring rhythm throughout the season.
- **Correlation Confidence**: A 0.99 Pearson correlation between shots and goals validates that shot volume is a strong predictor of scoring‚Äîhelpful for coaching focus.
- **Balanced Scoring vs. Defense** : The team averaged 13.63 goals scored and 12.53 goals allowed per game, showing a slight offensive edge.
- **Impact of Small Gains** : If Syracuse had scored one more goal in each loss, their record would improve from 10‚Äì9 to 13‚Äì6.
- **Clutch Factor of Top Scorers** : Top scorers contributed 57% of total points in wins, compared to only 42% in losses, indicating the team wins when star players are more involved.
- **Offense Over Defense** : Both the strong correlation between shots and goals and the scoring averages suggest that boosting offensive production could yield better outcomes than focusing solely on defense.

## Reflections & Findings

- **Strengths of LLMs:**
  - Very good at answering basic statistical and ranking queries (e.g., total games, top scorer, win/loss record).
  - Correctly maps domain-specific terms like ‚Äúplaymaker‚Äù to assists and ‚Äúclosest game‚Äù to smallest score margin.
  - Handles correlation questions effectively when the metric is explicitly stated.
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Struggles with ambiguous prompts (e.g., ‚Äúmost improved player‚Äù or ‚Äúshould coach focus on offense or defense‚Äù) unless the metric is defined.
  - Can produce plausible but wrong answers if conditions are not explicitly clarified (e.g., narrow losses initially miscounted).
  - Needs step-by-step refinement for multi-part analytical queries.
- **Prompt Engineering Tactics:**
  - Define ambiguous terms ‚Äì Clearly specify what metrics should be used for subjective terms.
           Example: ‚ÄúConsistency‚Äù ‚Üí Goals per game
           Example: ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù ‚Üí Points per game (Goals + Assists)
  - Break down multi-part questions ‚Äì Separate broad prompts into smaller, measurable parts.
           Example: ‚ÄúShould coach focus on offense or defense?‚Äù ‚Üí Compare average goals scored vs. allowed.
  - Use iterative follow-ups ‚Äì Refine unclear or incorrect responses by providing constraints and context.
           Example: Re-asking ‚Äúnarrow losses‚Äù with both loss condition and goal margin defined.
